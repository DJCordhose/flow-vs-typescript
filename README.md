## Versions

There are quite a few versions of this talk because I have given it at many conferences and also created variations
that contain elm. My advise is to only stick to these latest versions:

* Most up-to-data and complete version including Elm, Flow, and TypeScript: http://djcordhose.github.io/flow-vs-typescript/elm-flow-typescript.html
* Shorter version for [JFokus 2017](https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/talks.jsp#TypedJavaScriptwithT): http://djcordhose.github.io/flow-vs-typescript/2017_jfocus_elm.html
